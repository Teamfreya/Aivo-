**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

Aivo Labs ("we", "us", "our") operates the AIVO app ("the App"), a Nordic-first AI voice keyboard for iOS. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.

We believe in transparency. This policy is written in plain language so you can understand exactly what happens with your data.

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information

When you sign in with Apple Sign In, we receive and store:

- **Email address** (or the private relay address Apple provides if you choose to hide your email)

This information is used solely to identify your account.

### 2.2 Microphone Audio

The App records audio through your device microphone when you activate voice input. This audio is:

- **Never stored permanently** on your device or our servers. Audio data is discarded immediately after transcription.

### 2.3 Transcription Text

The text returned from transcription is stored **locally on your device** as part of your transcription history. You can disable this storage entirely by enabling Privacy Mode in the App settings.

### 2.4 Usage Statistics

We collect basic usage statistics **locally on your device**, including:

- Word count
- Words per minute (WPM)

These statistics never leave your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 OpenAI

We use two OpenAI services to power the App:

- **OpenAI Whisper API** -- Your recorded audio is sent to OpenAI's servers for transcription. OpenAI processes this audio to return text and does not use your data to train its models when accessed via the API. See [OpenAI's API data usage policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) for details.

- **OpenAI GPT API** -- When you use text processing features (such as grammar correction or professional tone), the transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's GPT API. The same data usage policy applies.

OpenAI acts as a data processor on our behalf. Audio and text sent to OpenAI are processed in accordance with their data processing terms and are not retained by OpenAI for model training purposes.

### 5.2 Apple Sign In

Authentication is handled through Apple Sign In. Apple's own privacy policy governs how Apple handles your authentication data. We only receive the email and name you authorize Apple to share.

---

## 6. Data Storage and Security

| Data | Where Stored | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Account info | Locally on your device | Until you delete your account or the App |
| Audio recordings | Temporarily in memory | Discarded immediately after transcription |
| Transcription history | Locally on your device (App Groups/UserDefaults) | Until you clear history or delete the App; not stored at all if Privacy Mode is enabled |
| Usage statistics | Locally on your device | Until you delete the App |

We do not operate backend servers that store your personal data. Data on your device is protected by iOS platform security, including device encryption.

---

## 7. International Data Transfers

When audio is sent to OpenAI for transcription or text is sent for processing, that data may be processed on servers located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States. OpenAI provides appropriate safeguards for such transfers in accordance with GDPR requirements, including standard contractual clauses.

---

## 8. Your Rights Under GDPR

As a user in the European Economic Area, you have the following rights:

- **Right of Access** -- You can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Right to Rectification** -- You can ask us to correct inaccurate data.
- **Right to Erasure** -- You can ask us to delete your personal data. Since most data is stored locally on your device, you can also delete it by removing the App or clearing your history.
- **Right to Restrict Processing** -- You can ask us to limit how we process your data.
- **Right to Data Portability** -- You can request your data in a structured, machine-readable format.
- **Right to Object** -- You can object to processing based on legitimate interest.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent** -- You can withdraw consent for microphone access at any time through your iOS Settings. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before withdrawal.

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at [privacy@aviolabs.eu](mailto:privacy@aviolabs.eu). We will respond within 30 days.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For Nordic countries:
